= Linux Tips =
* Avoid the ssh prompt for asking the confirmation to add host to known_hosts: 
 * add the line:*StrictHostKeyChecking=no* in either files:/etc/ssh/ssh_config, ~/.ssh/config, or specific it in command line:
   `ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no`. 
* Enable the X11 fowwarding defaultly:~/.ssh/config:`ForwardX11=yes`
* Install the packages from RPM: `rpm2cpio packages.rpm | cpio -idv`
* Querying the LSF group host information: `bmgroup`
* add the 'Window List' to the pannel: to make the windows like task icon.
* tcsh: bind the arrow keys to search the command line history:
  * `bindkey -k up history-search-backward`
  * `bindkey -k down history-search-forward`
* find the broken links: `find -type l -follow`
* Get the changelist number of current workspace: `p4 changes -m 1 #have`
* vim: `set clipboard=unnamed`: use the "* register as the holding place for yank and paste.
* xterm: the `shift + insert` and `middle mouse button` paste from vim "* register.
* firefox: the `shift + insert` paste from vim "+ register; the 'middle mouse button' paste from "* register.
* xterm: show the chinese characters(it requires specific font library):
  # add following lines to ~/.Xresources
    {{{text
      XTerm*faceName: Consolas:style=Regular:antialias=True:pixelsize=20
      XTerm*faceNameDoublesize:AR PL Uming CN
    }}}
  # reload the resource files by `xrdb -merge .Xresources`. 
  # restart xterm.
* tcsh shell script can't be exited phenomenon may be caused by the locking of .history, it can be remedied by remove the .history.

* awk perform calculation examples:
  {{{sh
    cat data|awk '{sum+=$1} END {print "Sum = ", sum}'
    cat data|awk '{sum+=$1} END {print "Average = ", sum/NR}'
    cat data|awk 'BEGIN {max = 0} {if ($1>max) max=$1 } END {print "Max=", max}'
    awk 'BEGIN {min = 1999999} {if ($1<min) min=$1} END {print "Min=", min}'
  }}}
* bash: `set -o pipefail`: defaultly, the return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command, unless the pipefail
  option is enabled. If *pipefail* is enabled, the pipeline's return status is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit
  with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully. this is useful to inject the a tee pipe for the commannd in
  makefile and also can exit immediately
* perforce: steps to rollback to early version:
  {{{sh
    p4 sync somefile#2 # retrieve the early version
    p4 edit somefile
    p4 sync somefile # sync to latest version
    p4 resolve -ay # resolve and accept your local copy.
