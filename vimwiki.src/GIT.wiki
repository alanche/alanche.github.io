* Diff the working copy with the latest version:
 * `git diff HEAD file`
* push your code to the remote branches:
 * git push origin umc_dev
* pull other modification to local:
 * git pull origin umc_dev
* merge a single file *file* from other branch B to branch A:
  {{{
  # if the B is remote, please checkout it firstly.
  git checkout B # make branch B available at local git
  git checkout A # switch to branch A
  git checkout --patch B file # patch it.
  }}}
* compare the content of file *file* in two version *a* and *b* by: `git diff a b -- file`
* list the files in the bare repository:
  * cd into the bare tree and do: `git ls-tree --full-tree -r HEAD`
